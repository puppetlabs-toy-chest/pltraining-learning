This is the Puppet Enterprise Learning VM.

This CentOS-based VM comes with Puppet Enterprise pre-installed.
The Learning VM includes an interactive Quest Guide that will walk
you through the essentials of Puppet and the Puppet domain specific
language. This Quest Guide is hosted as a website on the VM itself.
To get started, navigate to http://<VM's IPADDRESS> on your host machine.

To view the Learning VM's current IP address, enter the command
`facter ipaddress`.

If you have any issues, please refer to the troubleshooting guide
that accompanied your Learning VM download.

We're also glad to recieve questions and comments at:
